Name: Environment Monitoring System

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, and
effective environmental monitoring system that can be used in homes, offices, and other
indoor environments. The system will help people maintain a healthy and comfortable
environment by monitoring and displaying real-time readings of temperature, light
intensity, and moisture levels. The project can also serve as a starting point for further
research and development in environmental monitoring systems.

Inputs: sensors for temperature, light intensity, and moisture levels. These sensors are
connected to the Tiva LaunchPad microcontroller through the Grove Base BoosterPack.

Outputs: The output for this project is the real-time display of sensor readings and weather on the
7-segment display along with an alarm that alerts the user if the environmental
conditions go outside the preset range.

Features: Environment monitoring system that alternatively displays the temperature,
moisture, and light intensity. The LED in the Tiva Launchpad turns red if the environmental
readings of sensors are hazardous numbers.


Component Cost: 
Tivaware Launchpad: $55
GroveBase Kit: $65
Total: $120

Leveraged proficiency in C and ARM Assembly to write efficient and reliable firmware for the microcontroller.

Integrated and interfaced with a variety of environmental sensors (light, temperature, moisture, and buzzer) to capture and analyze precise data from the surroundings.

Created a unique feature set enabling the microcontroller to accurately distinguish between the summer and fall seasons based on the analyzed environmental data.

Developed a sophisticated algorithm that enables seasonal differentiation, achieved by effectively collating and analyzing data from various sensors thereby showcasing the effective design of the system's hardware and software components.
